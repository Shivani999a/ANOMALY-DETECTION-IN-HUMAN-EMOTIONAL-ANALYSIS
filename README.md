# Anomaly Detection in Human Emotional Analysis

# Introduction

This project focuses on anomaly detection in human emotions using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The system processes real-time video feeds to detect and analyze human emotions and identify anomalies in emotional patterns. It leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and OpenCV for facial recognition and classification.

# Features

Real-time emotion detection using a webcam.

Classification of emotions into categories: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, Surprise.

Anomaly detection for unusual emotional expressions.

Uses CNN (Inception V3) and SVM for emotion classification.

Trained using datasets like FER2013 and CK+.

# Technologies Used

Python 3.7

TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning

OpenCV for real-time face detection

NumPy for data manipulation

CV2 Haarcascade Classifier for face recognition
# Dataset

The model is trained on:

FER2013 (Facial Expression Recognition 2013)

CK+ (Extended Cohn-Kanade Dataset)
# Results

The system successfully detects emotions and identifies anomalies in emotional patterns. It provides real-time visualization of detected emotions.

# Future Enhancements

Improved multi-modal fusion (integrating voice and text analysis)

Contextual understanding for better emotion classification

Fine-grained emotion detection beyond basic categories

Integration with mental health applications
